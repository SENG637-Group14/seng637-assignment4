# Introduction
Building upon the foundations established in our previous labs, this report details our exploration of advanced testing techniques, specifically mutation testing and web application testing. As a continuation of the previous labs, in this lab, we're doing two types of software testing. First, we're using Pitest to see how good our old tests are at finding bugs in the `Range` and `DataUtilities` code. We'll try to make our tests better so they catch more bugs (increase the "mutation score").

Second, we're using Selenium to test "Air Canada" website. We'll create tests to check if different parts of the website work correctly.

You can find the website tests in the root folder (.side files), and the updated bug-finding tests in the "org.jfree.data" part of the "JFreeChart_Lab4" folder. 

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the assignment itself
